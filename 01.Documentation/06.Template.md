# Template Jinja2

- Configurations are the lifeblood of networking devices and could be, to draw a relation 
to software engineering, regarded as the source code of a network. When writing such 
configuration files, it can be handy to build templates that parts can be reused from. In 
this chapter, we will see how we can programmatically build and render such templates 
using a templating language called Jinja2.

- The applications of this are manifold. Think of a script that reaches out to your IP Address 
Management (IPAM) system and automatically builds a configuration based on the 
information and the template you have written


- Template is super important when we deploy ~500 devices.

## Some normal task when using Jinja2

1. Write configuration as template (tlp file or j2 file)
2. Load template
3. Using for / if / module / function / block
4. Render to configuration for each device
