# PyATS and Genie

### Concept

pyATS is the core framework supported within Cisco Systems, and it was initially developed for the internal Cisco engineering team’s use. It uses the Genie library as the pyATS standard library and XPRESSO for the pyATS web dashboard.


pyATS is more of a supplementary tool than the primary automation tool. Some of the supported  features include the following:
  - Cisco’s default test framework for internal Cisco engineers across different platform/ functions, running millions of CI/CD, sanity, regression, scale, HA, solution
  - Used by millions of engineers and developers
  - A standard open source, platform/vendor-agnostic library system (Genie)
  - A web dashboard to manage your test suites, testbeds, test results, and their insights (XPRESSO)
  - Integration support for other integration tools in the form of libraries, extensions, plugins, and APIs
  - Support for building customers’ business logic and solutions on top of the infrastructure stack
  - Primarily focuses on Cisco devices
